                        Samera Simha Jayasimha, aka RANDI, is like a mixtape of contradictions! He's the kind of dude who's as irritating as a mosquito in your ear, as annoying asshole, and as self-cool as a penguin wearing sunglasses in the Arctic. His confidence is god level, he is one of the Elite species of monkeys which r in the  endangered list, while operating with just two brain cells doing the tango inside his noggin! According to our knowledge he belongs to rainforests somewhere in AFRICA

He flirts so much, he probably flirts with his own reflection in the mirror! This dude's the king of not knowing where the line between playful and creepy is,  he still thinks he's as cool as a cucumber.

                        His secret recipe for coolness? Dropping caste-related jokes or discrimination bombs. But hey, sad news - people are less interested in him than a they are in chemistry lecture!                    </h5>

                        Burj Khalifa of the class but nigga version of it 
This Niggagigga ruling the back of the class kingdom. While everyone's lost in CS class, he's hosting his very own "Smash or Pass" game show! Teachers adore him, but when it comes to dancing, think more "dancing disaster" than a pro. He's like a walking paradox.
He calls girls cute but is scared af to talk to them, similar to ADMIRING A BUILDING FROM FAR WITHOUT GOING INSIDE.

                        This nigga is one of the rare species of our class.
Nigga from SOUTH KOREA  who's like a super silly comedian. He have the wackiest ideas ever! When it's cold, this nigga is like, "Nah, cold doesn't bother me!" And if he step out in the rain, he believes the rain gets confused and soaked instead of him. His brain runs on a track of goofy thoughts that make no sense

during physics class, he goes, "Hey, sir, how do you make a nuclear fission bomb?" Yep, that kind of absurdity! Everyone in the class knows he caries bomb in his bag, It's a black hole- you name it, he's got it there.

                        Amidst a crowd of dark-skinned folks, theres a WHITE NIGGA. He is complete with a plumpy appearance, glasses, and a charmingly tomato-red face when he gets all riled up. He's like the neighborhood tomato on legs! Plus, he's never seen without his trusty grey jacket. We guess he is a suicide bomber with bomb inside it.

                        This fella's life mission seems to revolve around impressing the ladies. Inspired by is buddy[PK]
                        He's on a never-ending quest to woo them. He might not always succeed, but his determination could power a rocket to Jupiter!

                        This nigger is forever glued to his tab no matter the class subject! It's almost like, "Dude, why are you even here?" But the real comedy starts at lunch break. You know it's lunchtime when he and his pals dive into Clash Royale, and suddenly it's like a zoo erupted in the classroom!
His shouts can wake the dead! Sure thing! They go wild playing the game, making a ruckus that drives everyone nuts. But if you ever lack stationery, he's your savior – the walking supply closet!

                        meet BJ - the human enigma of gender-guessing with a smooth baby face that makes everyone ponder, "Are you sure?" He's the self-proclaimed cool cat, but reality's more like a lukewarm kitten. He checks people out in the corridors and says "smash".

This dude's got the "No Help Zone" sign plastered all over him, a certified member of the Irritate & Annoy Club, especially when it comes to Sameera. His favorite vocal exercise? Chanting "gay", and boy, he is the king of laziness.

And, surprise, a junior crush! BJ's the undercover blusher, secretly turning pink when his she is nearby, giving a whole new meaning to a top-secret crush operation.

                        This guy's the class's unofficial therapist, ready to debate about absolutely anything! He's a comic book connoisseur, out-reading even Stan Lee. His tag-team chaos act with that African monkey aka SAMEERA is a spectacle worth a front-row seat!

When it comes to girls, let's just say he's 0 for 18; not even a senior's glance has fallen his way! But in the gaming world, he's a tycoon, stacking up the digital dollars like a pro. And when the clouds of enlightenment roll in, he becomes a brainiac powerhouse - but only when he's high on meth!

Godfather of bunking classes, leading his comrades into freedom from lectures, all while having a stronger bond with anime than with college books! Calculus serves as his tissue paper, exam papers as his tablecloth, he's the grandmaster of pretending-to-listen in class. While he nods along, little do the teachers know that beneath the table, he's running his illegal business of selling ganga to kushl! It's like he's got a Mastercard in the art of deception, operations done right under teachers noses!

Meet Mr. Anger-Issues-Slash-Romeo, the guy who casts a wide net on various girls but ends up fixing his radar on one lucky soul for a while. He's like a scaredy-cat in disguise, not just with girls but even teachers! His mood swings? Well, they're as unpredictable as Bangalore's weather changes.

Get ready for the cringe-fest because he's the master of delivering jokes that could make even a rock cringe. I mean, calling a water can "expensive" because it's named "IClass"? Classic cringe alert! Plus, his left hand seems to have an eternal love affair with his pocket. And he's got this habit of randomly labeling himself as "gay." Quite mysterious

Confidence level? Sky-high! He parades around with a glass water bottle, defying the laws of fear. He's the Sympathy King, smiling at everything and even at Sameera's jokes - even [they're as lame as the daddest dad joke!]

Girl attempt conversation, but he's more into the guy. He's the silent protagonist, so quiet that we are blessed to hear his voice

Yet, his loyalty is as reliable as his ever-changing hoodie collection—today it's red maroon, tomorrow it's brown; not just them even his earphones keep changing as the season changes; lets just accept commitment is not his cup of tea🍵!

Man wants attention so bad that he spreads his own rumor and still doesn't get any attention. Nigga quite popular among lame college girls coz he is known for poor flirting skills and constant search for a girl  

And speaking of spectacular, his face? It's so plain, it could be used in math class! As for laziness? Suhas is the reigning champion of chill, the guy who takes 'relaxation' to Olympic levels. If there were medals for lounging, he'd be the undisputed gold medalist!

He speaks in a way that's more fitting for a playground than for serious conversations. Despite this, he's passionate enough to get involved in protests and express his opinions fervently. God seemed to experiment, poor guy ended up with small face plastered on a 6-foot frame, giving the word "PROPORTION" a run for its money!

A romantic novel lover, spending his days daydreaming about being the swoon-worthy characters. Why is this guy always near the walls of corridor? Is he gearing up for a heroic Spider-Man moment, swooping in to rescue his beloved, or is he just lost in his daydreams?

                        Karthik, the elusive NCC ninja, vanishes from classes under the reason of NCC duty, yet spends his days mastering the art of watching reels. He's like a chameleon, effortlessly  blending into the background of attendance sheets. This guy's a legend, he'll challenge teachers to a duel if they dare question his absences— truly believing he's Hogwarts material . He's attracts drama like a lightning rod, attempting to slap anyone who crosses his path, but won't admit he's into boys . 
Karthik's mix—religious chants paired with curse words frr

                        The ultimate show-off! Born to flex, especially when unveiling a new pen as if it's the rarest gem on Earth when everyone else has one tooo. He roams around like he's the college's CEO, yet he's the first one to complain about everything. This guy hits the gym to pump iron but fails to lift a kid's backpack. Walking with confidence? More like walking with an inflated ego!

And those muscles he's so proud of? Well, they seem to have an undefeated record in losing arm-wrestling matches. As for his sense of humor, let's just say he's the only one laughing at his own jokes.

He's the self-proclaimed YouTuber who won't quit reminding everyone until YouTube finally kicks him out. With spies scattered all over campus, he's practically the RAW of the college, knowing every detail of what's happening before it even happens!

                        Sripad, the unsolvable person! He's the paradoxical Sherlock of our class, chanting peace while giggling at every offensive joke, draped in KAPPA clothing, throwing up that eternal ✌✌ pose, yet with two fingers lifted, still no luck with the ladies.
                        [Probably coz 🖕+☝=✌] His face is a canvas of teenage rebellion with Pimples glory. He's the Invisible Man to teachers, even when he message them ,BRO COMMON WHO GETS SEENZONED BY TEACHERS !! Playing the innocent card while secretly tangled up in every situation.
                        
                        But hold the popcorn, folks! The real show is the ongoing saga between him and Ganesh, their dynamic stirring more suspicious than a UFO sighting in a small town! These two are like the elusive yet X-Files of the campus.

                        "Ganesh? Oh, he's the dark knight of our class!! When it goes dark, he's like a magician who disappears into thin air – NGL! 

And those pearly white teeth of his? Let's just say they are brighter than your future🦷. His commitment to the color black might even rival the darkness of space itself!

Ever tried to have a conversation with him? Well, good luck! Ganesh can take you into depression faster than the speed of light. He's the captain of the daydreamers, lost in thought.

It seems Ganesh turns classroom objects into comedy partners—romancing the desks and benches as if they were characters in real life! His humor might be rated "18+" in the joke department, making him the king of dark and dirty jokes.

How can you forget bout Ganesh and Sripad? Their silent, meaningful gazes across the classroom could script a romantic novel!

                        Jayanth, living comedy, sketch straight out of a movie! He goes by Kamakya Jayanth, associated with a place but actually lives somewhere else. Despite trying to act tough like a gangster, he gets a case of nerves during fights and ends up peeing his pants. Poor guy!!!
He's a self-proclaimed 'dad of the class' who is plump and neckless, walking on escalators as his exercise routine. His attempts at being funny often backfire coz, his face just naturally makes people laugh. Despite boasting about ruling Kamakya, the truth is far from it. What's more, he's into watching Bigg Boss - not in Hindi nor Kannada but in Telugu! As for his 'early bird' study routine? More like a 'rise and nap' strategy. He starts his study at 4am and doze offf at 4:05am on his study table
