                        Samera Simha Jayasimha, aka RANDI, is like a mixtape of contradictions! He's the kind of dude who's as irritating as a mosquito in your ear, as annoying asshole, and as self-cool as a penguin wearing sunglasses in the Arctic. His confidence is god level, he is one of the Elite species of monkeys which r in the  endangered list, while operating with just two brain cells doing the tango inside his noggin! According to our knowledge he belongs to rainforests somewhere in AFRICA

                        Here's the grandmaster of flirting, also Kozhi "creep flirt", mixing up his charms like a bartender shaking cocktails. He flirts so much, he probably flirts with his own reflection in the mirror! This dude's the king of not knowing where the line between playful and creepy is,  he still thinks he's as cool as a cucumber.

                        His secret recipe for coolness? Dropping caste-related jokes or discrimination bombs. But hey, sad news - people are less interested in him than a they are in chemistry lecture!                    </h5>

                        Burj Khalifa of the class but nigga version of it 
This Niggagigga ruling the back of the class kingdom. While everyone's lost in CS class, he's hosting his very own "Smash or Pass" game show! Teachers adore him, but when it comes to dancing, think more "dancing disaster" than a pro. He's like a walking paradox.
He calls girls cute but is scared af to talk to them, similar to ADMIRING A BUILDING FROM FAR WITHOUT GOING INSIDE.

                        This nigga is one of the rare species of our class.
Nigga from SOUTH KOREA  who's like a super silly comedian. He have the wackiest ideas ever! When it's cold, this nigga is like, "Nah, cold doesn't bother me!" And if he step out in the rain, he believes the rain gets confused and soaked instead of him. His brain runs on a track of goofy thoughts that make no sense

                        This weird nigga is a walking paradox he is like pineapple pizza craving in a chocolate factory, skinny but bursting with.........! He's not afraid of a tussle, even if others are stronger. Despite being called "MULLA"  AKING WHY¿¿
during physics class, he goes, "Hey, sir, how do you make a nuclear fission bomb?" Yep, that kind of absurdity! Everyone in the class knows he caries bomb in his bag, It's a black hole- you name it, he's got it there.

                        Amidst a crowd of dark-skinned folks, theres a WHITE NIGGA. He is complete with a plumpy appearance, glasses, and a charmingly tomato-red face when he gets all riled up. He's like the neighborhood tomato on legs! Plus, he's never seen without his trusty grey jacket. We guess he is a suicide bomber with bomb inside it.

                        This fella's life mission seems to revolve around impressing the ladies. Inspired by is buddy[PK]
                        He's on a never-ending quest to woo them. He might not always succeed, but his determination could power a rocket to Jupiter!

                        This nigger is forever glued to his tab no matter the class subject! It's almost like, "Dude, why are you even here?" But the real comedy starts at lunch break. You know it's lunchtime when he and his pals dive into Clash Royale, and suddenly it's like a zoo erupted in the classroom!
His shouts can wake the dead! Sure thing! They go wild playing the game, making a ruckus that drives everyone nuts. But if you ever lack stationery, he's your savior – the walking supply closet!

                        meet BJ - the human enigma of gender-guessing with a smooth baby face that makes everyone ponder, "Are you sure?" He's the self-proclaimed cool cat, but reality's more like a lukewarm kitten. He checks people out in the corridors and says "smash".

This dude's got the "No Help Zone" sign plastered all over him, a certified member of the Irritate & Annoy Club, especially when it comes to Sameera. His favorite vocal exercise? Chanting "gay", and boy, he is the king of laziness.

And, surprise, a junior crush! BJ's the undercover blusher, secretly turning pink when his she is nearby, giving a whole new meaning to a top-secret crush operation.

                        This guy's the class's unofficial therapist, ready to debate about absolutely anything! He's a comic book connoisseur, out-reading even Stan Lee. His tag-team chaos act with that African monkey aka SAMEERA is a spectacle worth a front-row seat!

When it comes to girls, let's just say he's 0 for 18; not even a senior's glance has fallen his way! But in the gaming world, he's a tycoon, stacking up the digital dollars like a pro. And when the clouds of enlightenment roll in, he becomes a brainiac powerhouse - but only when he's high on meth!

                        Pandeji, who turns college into a mere pit stop on his way back home. He's the silent hero turned into bunking mesterio. Godfather of bunking classes, leading his comrades into freedom from lectures, all while having a stronger bond with anime than with college books! Calculus serves as his tissue paper, exam papers as his tablecloth, he's the grandmaster of pretending-to-listen in class. While he nods along, little do the teachers know that beneath the table, he's running his illegal business of selling ganga to kushl! It's like he's got a Mastercard in the art of deception, operations done right under teachers noses!

                        Ah, here's a rollercoaster of emotions! Meet Mr. Anger-Issues-Slash-Romeo, the guy who casts a wide net on various girls but ends up fixing his radar on one lucky soul for a while. He's like a scaredy-cat in disguise, not just with girls but even teachers! His mood swings? Well, they're as unpredictable as Bangalore's weather changes.

Get ready for the cringe-fest because he's the master of delivering jokes that could make even a rock cringe. I mean, calling a water can "expensive" because it's named "IClass"? Classic cringe alert! Plus, his left hand seems to have an eternal love affair with his pocket. And he's got this habit of randomly labeling himself as "gay." Quite mysterious

Confidence level? Sky-high! He parades around with a glass water bottle, defying the laws of fear. He's the Sympathy King, smiling at everything and even at Sameera's jokes - even [they're as lame as the daddest dad joke!]

Girl attempt conversation, but he's more into the guy. He's the silent protagonist, so quiet that we are blessed to hear his voice
